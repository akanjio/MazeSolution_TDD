# MazeSolution_TDD
The task is to write a solution to a m x n maze, the maze will be given as a text file and have only one solution.
The 1st line in the maze file denotes the grid size of the maze. i.e 5 6 -> x.size = 5, y.size = 6
The 2nd line states is the start point of the maze
the 3rd line states the end point or exit of the maze
All other lines contain the maze. 1 denotes a wall and 0 a traversable space. 
The program should produce an output detailing the path from start to end/exit. 
In the output; convert the 1s to #, 0s to '  ', mark the start point with S, the end with E and mark the path from S to E with X.
